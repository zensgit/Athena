# P4 PR-37 RM Snapshot Dashboard Verification

## Implementation Summary

`PR-37` was implemented as a frontend-only RM snapshot dashboard slice.

Delivered behavior:

- RM admin page now renders `Declared Record Coverage Snapshot`
- RM admin page now renders `Governed Operations Snapshot`
- both snapshot cards derive their values from already-loaded RM summary/records/operations data
- no backend API changes were introduced

## Files Changed

Frontend:

- `ecm-frontend/src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.tsx`
- `ecm-frontend/src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.test.tsx`

Documentation:

- `docs/P4_PR37_RM_SNAPSHOT_DASHBOARD_DESIGN_20260415.md`
- `docs/P4_RECORDS_MANAGEMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN_20260414.md`
- `docs/P4_RECORDS_MANAGEMENT_ACCEPTANCE_20260414.md`

## Targeted Validation

Command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.test.tsx
```

Result:

- `Test Suites: 1 passed`
- `Tests: 23 passed`

## Full Regression

Command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

Result:

- `Test Suites: 71 passed, 71 total`
- `Tests: 355 passed, 355 total`

Build command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
npm run build
```

Build result:

- `Compiled with warnings`
- production build completed successfully
- remaining warnings are pre-existing unused imports in:
  - `ecm-frontend/src/components/share/ShareLinkManager.tsx`
  - `ecm-frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`

## Static Checks

Command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result:

- passed

## Verification Conclusion

`PR-37` is approved. The RM admin page now exposes a lightweight snapshot dashboard for declared-record coverage and governed-operations queue health without any backend API change.
