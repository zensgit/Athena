# P4 PR-33 Governed Operations Filter Summary Verification

## Implementation Summary

`PR-33` was implemented as a frontend-only RM operations filter-summary slice.

Delivered behavior:

- `Governed Operations` now exposes a unified `Selected operations filters` summary when any import or transfer filter is active
- summary shows scoped filter chips for active import/transfer queue, exact-status, and reason conditions
- summary exposes scoped clear actions and a global clear-all action

## Files Changed

Frontend:

- `ecm-frontend/src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.tsx`
- `ecm-frontend/src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.test.tsx`

Documentation:

- `docs/P4_PR33_OPERATIONS_FILTER_SUMMARY_DESIGN_20260415.md`
- `docs/P4_RECORDS_MANAGEMENT_EXECUTION_PLAN_20260414.md`
- `docs/P4_RECORDS_MANAGEMENT_ACCEPTANCE_20260414.md`

## Targeted Validation

Command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand src/pages/RecordsManagementPage.test.tsx
```

Result:

- `Test Suites: 1 passed`
- `Tests: 20 passed`

## Full Regression

Command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

Result:

- `Test Suites: 71 passed, 71 total`
- `Tests: 352 passed, 352 total`

Build command:

```bash
cd ecm-frontend
npm run build
```

Build result:

- `Compiled with warnings`
- production build completed successfully
- remaining warnings are pre-existing unused imports in:
  - `ecm-frontend/src/components/share/ShareLinkManager.tsx`
  - `ecm-frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`

## Static Checks

Command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result:

- passed

## Verification Conclusion

`PR-33` is approved. The RM dashboard now exposes a unified selected-filters summary for active import and transfer drilldown state without any backend API change.
