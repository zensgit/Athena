# Athena ECM - Development Summary

> **Date**: 2025-12-10
> **Version**: 1.0.0 (Release)
> **Status**: Deployment Ready ✅

## Executive Summary

Athena ECM has reached a major milestone with the completion of the **Full Stack Online Editing** feature. The system now offers a complete user journey from uploading and organizing documents to editing them directly in the browser using integrated office suites (WPS/Office Online).

## Final Polish (Sprint 7+)

We have refined the frontend experience to make the powerful backend features accessible:
*   **Context Menus**: Added "Edit Online" option to the file list context menu.
*   **Preview Integration**: Added "Edit Online" button directly within the document previewer.
*   **Seamless Navigation**: Users are smoothly transitioned between the file browser and the distraction-free editor interface.

## System Architecture

The final delivered system consists of:

1.  **Core Backend (Java/Spring Boot)**:
    *   Manages Metadata, Security, Versions, and Search.
    *   Hosts the **WOPI** and **WPS** integration endpoints.
2.  **Frontend (React)**:
    *   **File Browser**: Full feature grid with drag-and-drop.
    *   **Editor Page**: Dedicated route `/editor/:id` embedding the external editor iframe.
3.  **AI & Automation**:
    *   **ML Service**: Auto-classifies content in the background.
    *   **Workflow Engine**: Drives approval processes.

## Deployment Checklist

1.  **Configuration**:
    *   Update `ecm.wps.*` in `application.yml` with valid AppID/AppKey from WPS Open Platform.
    *   Ensure `ecm.api.base-url` matches the public-facing URL (for callbacks).
2.  **Infrastructure**:
    *   Run `docker-compose up -d --build`.
    *   Configure Nginx/Load Balancer for SSL (HTTPS is required for most Office Online integrations).

## Future Roadmap

*   **Collaboration**: Add real-time co-authoring support (requires specific WOPI lock extensions).
*   **Mobile App**: Build a React Native client consuming the existing REST APIs.
*   **Plugins**: Allow third-party developers to extend the Rule Engine actions.

## Recent Updates (2026-01-29)

*   **Mail Automation**: Added processed mail retention + cleanup with UI controls.
