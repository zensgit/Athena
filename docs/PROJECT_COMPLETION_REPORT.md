> **Date**: 2025-12-10
> **Version**: 1.0.0-RC1
> **Status**: Development Complete

## 1. Project Overview

Athena ECM (Enterprise Content Management) is a modern, scalable, and intelligent document management system. Over the course of 6 sprints, we have built a comprehensive backend platform that rivals commercial solutions in core capabilities.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

The system is built on a microservices-ready architecture:

*   **Core Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (JSONB for metadata)
*   **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch 8.11 (Full-text & Faceted search)
*   **Process Engine**: Flowable BPMN 7.0
*   **Storage**: MinIO (S3 compatible)
*   **AI/ML**: Python FastAPI (Sidecar service)
*   **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (Event bus)
*   **Cache**: Redis 7

## 3. Delivered Sprints

| Sprint | Feature Set | Key Deliverables | Status |
|--------|-------------|------------------|:------:|
| **1** | **Core Enhancements** | Bulk APIs, Content Types, Trash, Versioning | ✅ |
| **2** | **Workflow** | Document Approval Process, Task API, Flowable | ✅ |
| **3** | **Automation** | Rule Engine, ML Classification, Event Bus | ✅ |
| **4** | **UX & Search** | Folder Tree, Faceted Search, Suggestions | ✅ |
| **5** | **Analytics** | Audit Log, System Dashboard, Usage Stats | ✅ |
| **6** | **Integration** | Odoo ERP Sync, Email Archiving (.eml) | ✅ |

## 4. Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Automation
*   **Auto-Classification**: Uploaded documents are automatically analyzed by an ML model to suggest categories and tags.
*   **Rule Engine**: "If file > 10MB, notify admin" or "If name contains 'Contract', start approval workflow".

### 🔄 Business Process Management
*   **Approvals**: Built-in BPMN workflow for document review and sign-off.
*   **Audit Trail**: Every action (view, download, edit, approve) is cryptographically logged.

### 🔍 Advanced Search
*   **Smart Search**: Google-like search with auto-complete, highlighting, and "more like this".
*   **Facets**: Filter by file type, author, date range, or custom metadata tags.

### 🔗 Enterprise Integration
*   **Odoo ERP**: Seamlessly link documents to ERP records (Invoices, Customers).
*   **Email**: Drag-and-drop `.eml` files to archive emails with metadata extraction.

## 5. Deployment Guide

The entire stack is containerized. To start:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Athena/ecm-core.git

# 2. Build services
cd ecm-core && mvn clean package
cd ml-service && docker build -t ml-service .

# 3. Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Access
# API Docs: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

## 6. Future Recommendations

While the backend is feature-complete, future iterations should focus on:

1.  **Frontend Development**: Build a React Admin Dashboard to visualize the Analytics APIs and a Rule Builder UI.
2.  **Performance Testing**: Validate system behavior with 10M+ documents.
3.  **Cloud Native**: Create Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
