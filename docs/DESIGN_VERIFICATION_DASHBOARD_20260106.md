# Design: Verification Dashboard (2026-01-06)

## Goal
- Provide a single, up-to-date summary that links to the most important verification artifacts.

## Approach
- Create a dashboard markdown file that groups verification docs by area (backend, UI/UX, E2E, search, share links, audit export, rules).
- Keep the dashboard lightweight and point to the full `docs/VERIFICATION_*.md` index for exhaustive coverage.

## Files
- docs/VERIFICATION_DASHBOARD_20260106.md
